# L1-Cache-Simulator-COL216
This project is a C++ simulation of an L1 data cache for a quad-core processor, with support for cache coherence using the MESI protocol. It models a write-back, write-allocate cache with LRU replacement policy. The simulator processes memory reference traces to analyze cache performance under different configurations.
